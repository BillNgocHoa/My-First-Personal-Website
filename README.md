# My-First-Personal-Website
This is my very first website. I made it right after my First Lecture on "Web application development" course. Because of that, this website is not perfect and contains many faults. However, I am quite proud of it. Eventhough the website doesn't look professionally, it is my effort and dedication in learning HTML and CSS at the very first stage.
## Note:
Recommend to open on 14-inch and 15-inch screen laptop.
